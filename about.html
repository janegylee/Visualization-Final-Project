        <h4>Motivations</h4>
				<p>
					With Netflix, Disney+ and various streaming platforms rising, it is crucial for big companies to 
					get a sense of what shows people are interested in so that they can retain their users. Also, 
					this would benefit the users since they would be able to access their favorite shows on the streaming 
					platforms, being able to escape from any emotional stress caused at this time of uncertainty. 
					Through our project, we hope to provide meaningful information and trends regarding movies on 
					multiple streaming platforms for the companies as well as the consumers.
